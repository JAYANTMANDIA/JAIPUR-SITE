    <P>The **Hawa Mahal**, or "Palace of Winds," is one of Jaipur's most iconic landmarks. This stunning structure, built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was designed by the architect Lal Chand Ustad. The Hawa Mahal is renowned for its unique honeycomb-like façade, adorned with 953 small windows (or "jharokhas") that allowed royal women to observe the bustling street life below without being seen. The windows were designed to let cool breezes pass through, providing natural ventilation and keeping the palace comfortable in the hot desert climate.

        Made of pink sandstone, the Hawa Mahal features a blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles, with intricate carvings, arches, and delicate lattice work. It stands as a five-story building, though it appears to be much taller due to its narrow design. The palace doesn't have a traditional interior; instead, it is a façade with a series of small rooms behind it, offering a panoramic view of the city.
        
        The Hawa Mahal was originally part of the City Palace complex and served as a place for the women of the royal family to observe festivals, processions, and everyday life, without being exposed to the public eye. Today, it stands as a major tourist attraction, symbolizing the rich cultural heritage of Jaipur.</P>
    <h2>JAL MAHEL</h2>

     <p>**Jal Mahal**, meaning "Water Palace," is a stunning architectural marvel located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur, Rajasthan. This beautiful palace seems to float on the water, creating a serene and picturesque scene, especially during the early morning or sunset when the water reflects the structure’s grandeur.

        The palace was originally built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho Singh I, though it was later renovated and expanded by subsequent rulers. The architecture of Jal Mahal is a fine blend of Rajput and Mughal styles, with elegant arches, intricate carvings, and stunning domes that enhance its beauty. The palace has five stories, with the lower four submerged in water when the lake is full, giving it the illusion of being a floating palace.
        
        Jal Mahal was primarily used as a royal retreat for the kings and their families, offering a peaceful getaway from the bustling city life. Today, the palace is not open to the public, but visitors can enjoy spectacular views of the palace from the banks of the lake or from boats that can be rented to explore the area.
        
        In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the Jal Mahal is an important example of water conservation architecture, with its location on the lake acting as a means to manage the region’s water supply. Over the years, it has become one of Jaipur's most photographed and admired attractions.</p>
